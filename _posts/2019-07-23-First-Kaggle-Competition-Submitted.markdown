*Today Marks the first time I submitted an entry to a Kaggle competition, and boy can I tell you how exhilarating it is!*

# Origins
I first created my Kaggle profile on 12 July 2019, that’s a mere 11 days ago. Do note, I have no prior experience in machine learning and data science. My degree is in healthcare, and I can assure you - being born into a family, growing up and then working in this field for essentially my whole life, that most doctors have a less than desirable hold on math.

That's why it is so exciting for me to be able to achieve this milestone. So let's get into this!

## What is Kaggle?
Kaggle is a fast growing community of data scientists, machine learning professional and enthusiasts alike. It is a vibrant group with people all over the world. Kaggle is owned by Google - and its mission is to further data science. It has become a platform recently for large companies to source modes by running competitions.
The competition with the largest grand prize by far (**of $3 million!**) is the *Heritage Health Prize* about predicting readmission rates for patients. It happened 6 years ago. -[Check it out](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hhp)

## What was my submission?
I consider this Kaggle competition the "Hello World!" for machine learning. It is one of the great ways to learn the coding aspects, environment, notebooks, and data analysis and manipulation.

The competition I joined: "Housing Prices Competition"

* What: Predicting house prices in Iowa based on  from 33 given features of 1460 houses built between the years 1872 to 2010.
* How: Using Random Forest Regression, Python libraries - NumPy, scikit-learn, Pandas
* Results: 7030th out of 8322 submissions. This is scored by the *mean absolute error*, and a lower score is better, ie. your model can make predictions closer to the actual prices. My current mean absolute error is $21839.73, which means my average predictions for housing prices are about 20k off.

Though it's not the best model, for me it is a milestone to actually finish one and send it out.

## What's next?
I’m looking forwards to improving my model, getting more knowledgeable of how to optimize my scoring and sharing more with this community! And we’ll see another post when I get into my next Kaggle competition! I'm also thinking of updating my model further to see how much I can move up the leaderboard!
