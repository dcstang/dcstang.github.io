Dear all, recently came across this interesting article to read. It breaks down the potential of AI / ML in each field. A comprehensive report from the Stanford Group on how life is in 2030 with AI.

For those who don't have time to go through the whole report - this is the breakdown of the findings for the healthcare arena.

A quick summary of the healthcare aspects of the report, for those who don't have time to go through the whole thing.

Healthcare and AI in 2030
*Potential and promising domain to improve health outcomes*

Potential Areas Of Impact:
- Clinical decision support
- Patient monitoring and coaching systems
- Surgical Robotics
- Management systems in hospitals / facilities
- Mobile Health

**Clinical Decision Support**
- Emphasis on the "hands-on" experience of the physician
- Assistance in reducing daily physician workload
- Example: Mining scientific literature automatically - Cognitive Assistants
- Example implementation: Physician 'supervised' process of history taking

- Medical Imaging: probably not fully automated by 2030
- Focus on improving the speed with image triaging / second level checking

**Surgical Robotics**
- Increased competition in this area, initially dominated by da Vinci
- Alphabet's Verb and J&amp;J/Ethicon collaboration
- Innovation with image fusion, surgical data collection &amp; platform

**Automated Management / Operations Systems**
- Unsuccessful examples such as HelpMate 20 years ago
- Low investment by hospital groups in such technology, though proven effectiveness in other industries such as warehouses and hotels
- Not robust enough to accommodate spectrum of conditions yet, ie. patients with recent surgery, elderly patients, crowded corridors

**Mobile Health**
- collection of smartphone data to detect early warning signs - in Israel
- integration of "home devices", sensing devices for elderly, personalized rehabilitation, physical assistive devices
- Growing emergency of 'non-traditional' healthcare data from social platforms, wearables, IOT


**Current Issues**
- Gaining trust of doctors, nurses and patients
`History of poor implementation of electronic health records, eroding confidence`
- Regulatory, policy and commercial obstacles
`HIPAA barriers to flow of patient data &amp; FDA need to evaluate understanding of cost/benefit tradeoffs`
- Research and deployment slowed by outdated regulations and incentive structures
