Throughout the recent history of man, there has been three technological revolutions. These eras were marked with vast advancement in productivity, while also causing much changes to the way people lived.

Artificial intelligence advancement will usher in the fourth technological revolution. It is certain that this will cause us to do life differently. To prepare for this potential shakeup, it is good to look back at the past. Often, history is able to give us good lessons, as long as we are astute students of it.

## The first 3 revolutions

Number | Era | Revolution | Effect
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
1st | 1700s | Steam | Mobility & Urbanization
2nd | 1800s | Electricity | Mass Production
3rd | 1900s | Computing | Automation
4th | 2000s | Artificial intelligence | ??

The social impacts during each revolution were undeniable. It brought drastic change in social structure, large increases in wealth, and politics. During the revolution, it were those who were skilled or adaptable that survived well. Machinery skills and the ability to transition quickly from agriculture were highly valued during the time.

On the downside, this drastic change brought other issues for society to contend with. Overcrowding occurred in larger cities, where factories were located, leading to increased crime rate. A shift in social structure meant that women and children, who were previously expected to help out in farming tasks, now have to work with dangerous machines. This exploitation of the working class however, lead to labour laws, and eventually socialism as we know it today.
