Throughout the recent history of man, there has been three technological revolutions. These eras were marked with vast advancement in productivity, while also causing much changes to the way people lived.

Artificial intelligence advances will usher in the fourth technological revolution. This will without a doubt , make life as we know it different. Anticipating these changes will put us in a better position than others.

## The first 3 technological revolutions

Number | Era | Revolution | Effect
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
1st | 1700s | Steam | Mobility & Urbanization
2nd | 1800s | Electricity | Mass Production
3rd | 1900s | Computing | Automation
4th | 2000s | AI | ??

The social impacts during each revolution were undeniable. It brought drastic change in social structure, and large increases in wealth. During the revolution, those who were skilled or adaptable that survived well. Machinery skills and the ability to transition quickly from agriculture were highly valued during the time. The rise of tech unicorns such as Apple, Facebook and Netflix are apt examples of how large amounts of wealth were generated during the Internet era.

On the downside, these revolutions brought other issues for society to contend with. Because work opportunities were centered around machines within large cities, urbanization occurred at a rapid pace. Overcrowding at an unprecedented rate lead to increased crime rate. Besides that, changes in social structure meant that women and children, who were previously expected to help out in farming tasks, now have to work with dangerous machines. This exploitation of the working class however, lead formation of labor laws as we know it today.

## How to be prepared?

### Keeping up to date
We now have a multitude of tools to keep abreast with the latest developments in AI. I will compile a list of resources with a link soon. Twitter, Medium, podcasts, youtube and newsletters are just a few of these which we can use.

### Having the right skills
Stay ahead of the crowd by learning skills pertaining to AI. A couple of examples are picking up Python, trying out cloud based machine learning platforms, and simply working on incorporating some AI in your own projects will help immensely.

### Leading the change
Being the person to head the shift towards AI adoption in a particular industry is probably the most rewarding and exciting. This will require immense commitment, without a doubt. Yet because of this reason, is why spearheading the revolution will be the most fulfilling. As of time of writing, the implementation of AI in Healthcare is still in its infancy. What better time to be involved and lead the charge than NOW!
