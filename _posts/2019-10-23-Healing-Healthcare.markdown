Even within the world's best and well-funded healthcare system, there are pressing issues to look into. I was doing a bit of research into England's National Health Service (NHS) - looking at their performance and efficiency.

One thing that stood out to me was the growing size of people waiting to receive specialist treatment.

Over the years, the number of people on waiting lists is slowly creeping up. With over 4 million on the waiting list, is this a sign of the lack of specialists, inefficiency in the system, inadequate spending or increased demand? While there are probably a multitude of reasons, one thing is for sure - actual people who are sick and require treatment are not receiving it fast enough.

Looking at the problem, perhaps tackling it from another angle will help. There is a need to challenge the way healthcare is delivered. I believe the best way is to take a combination of sound clinical strategy combined with mass-delivery methods offered by technology. Without a doubt, treating a mild ailment is much easier than doing major surgery to correct long term complications of disease.

As I have mentioned in a previous article, there are many challenges to incorporate technology into the daily delivery of healthcare. For one, existing regulations that are protectionist or conservative might limit this expansion. The best way is to start contributing to the solution than shouting from the sidelines.

Ali Parsa, in the video above is a brave visionary that is looking to improve and transform the delivery of healthcare. It is a possibility with the tools that are mentioned:

* Diagnostics are becoming cheaper - 90% reduction in gene sequencing costs
* Technology and monitoring frontier - IOT, wearable tech and smartphones are commonplace tools
* Artificial intelligence adoption IS happening
* Newer technology being tested - nanotech, point-of-care risk testing

He envisions a time when the whole process of treatment history taking, medication tracking, complication monitoring is seamless with the use of voice recognition, machine learning and data. What a time to be alive and contribute to this movement!
