Had the recent privilege to take part in Google Next '19 UK. Was part of the 3 day event, with a day zero invitational session. Day zero, I was part of the cloud community training group, followed by a night session with the healthcare and life sciences cloud community.

Just fresh from the event, so I will quickly pop down some of the interesting points that I have picked up:

* NASA astrophysists are using Google Cloud AutoML to find stars!
* Use of AutoML is great in datasets with incredibly granular data - example light reflected from stars
* ML is great at discerning minute changes and patterns which are not immediately obvious to humans
* Size of datasets are in excess of 30 Petabytes each scans

* AutoML Language Processing section - applications in sentimental analysis of customer feedback to prioritize customer service officers attention
* Use of AutoML Conversational AI - triaging, replacement of robotic call centers with human like voice and syntax understanding, with transcription capabilities
* Use of AutoML to understand documents, emails, invoices for businesses - and sending them the right way
* Deepmind creation of WaveNet - the largest voice synthesizer and conversational deep neural network

* Cloud security features - data is encrypted and keys can be located outside datacenters
* Physical keys or mobile keys can be used as identifiers
* Data is split between multiple servers and encrypted separately
* Encrypted keys are encrypted with another key

* Google Cloud Healthcare API and data loss protection standards
* Compliance with GDPR, third party audits, patient de-identification with healthcare API
* Sanofi-Google Cloud collaboration - accelerate healthcare innovation, modernize architecture, forecasting and improving supply chain efforts
* Broad Institute collaboration - reducing genomic data analytics costs. They generate 27TB of data daily and have a growing set of 30PB of data

* De-identification of protected health information and personally identifiable information
* Data transformation methods - redact, mask, dateshift, crypto-hash
* Data from provider needs to be encrypted and ethical approval before bringing data to Cloud

* AI Hub functionality on Google Cloud - increase time spent on working on data analytics instead of just infrastructure
* What-IF tool for debugging model predictions and increase AI explanability. Can be used for vision models as well, which shows which pixels are determinant of predictions
* g.co/explanable-ai

* "Responsible AI"
* Things to think of: What does it mean when deploying AI? What are the possible impacts and where can trust be broken?
* AI launch - is about reliability, data quality, prior standards and stakeholders discussions, trust

* Deloitte - Google collaboration to improve healthcare research and build more solutions on Cloud
* English Football association transition to Cloud analytics, IOT
* Vodafone - generation of 2700 PBs of data annually
* Spotify - collecting millions of data points daily
* 30% of data will comprise of streaming data by 2025, and majority of decisions will be based on this kind of dataset
* Radical simplicity with G suite integration, bigquery and sheets connection
