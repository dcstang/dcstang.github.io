# About:

I have always been curious about trying out something new and cutting edge. Since I have discovered artificial intelligence, I have been trying to implement some of my own! I strongly believe there exists various opportunities to apply machine learning in healthcare.

This is my personal blog, where I share my journey through navigating this new field. Feel free to check out my github [here](https://github.com/dcstang). If you would like to contact me for coffee or a chat, drop me a message on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-tang-mrcp/).

I also help to host machine learning events, and workshops for beginners. Find out more about our next event at this meetup [page](https://www.meetup.com/beginners-machine-learning-london/).
